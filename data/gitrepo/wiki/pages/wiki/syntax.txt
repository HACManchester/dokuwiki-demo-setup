# Wiki Syntax

The pages are set to render everything inside as markdown by default using the CommonMark plugin.  
There is a way to specify native dokuwiki syntax as well though within the markdown.  
This means we can use markdown as a default but also add in any special plugin controls as well as a bonus.

To render native dokuwiki syntax we need to use a code fence block labled with the `dokuwiki` name  
Some controls / plugins don't require this depending on how they're written / the syntax used.

~~~
```dokuwiki
# Dokuwiki syntax goes here
```

Markdown is a more modern syntax currently used on github and also the same one used on the discourse mailing list website we're using.

## New lines

With markdown by default if you place one line of text directly below another one.
Then both will be joined together without a newline but with a space such as this paragraph.

To force a newline add a double space at the end of the line `  `  
This will force the newline at the end of a line within a paragraph

## Links

The normal syntax for markdown links is
```
[Plugins](.:plugins)
```
We can also use the dokuwiki syntax for links as well (which I admit is back to front compared to the above)
```
[[Plugins|.:plugins]]
```

## Fixme

One of the inbuilt controls that still works without any code fences is the Fixme label.  
If we write the text `FIXME` in all capitals the end result is FIXME

## Plugins

For the rest see the [[.:plugins]] section
