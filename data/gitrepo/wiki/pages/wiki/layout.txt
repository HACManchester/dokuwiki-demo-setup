# Page Layouts

## URL Paths

Unlike mediawiki dokuwiki uses a folder based approach for storing it's content.  
In the url for example this page will be `/doku.php?id=wiki:layout`  
The `wiki:layout` represents the path to the page with the `:` acting as a directory seperator.

## Adding / Removing Pages

Lets say I want to creat
e a page within `tools:woodworking:bandsaw`  

  * First I type in the url in the browser to point to `/doku.php?id=tools:woodworking:bandsaw`
  * Next dokuwiki will tell me the page doesn't exist.
  * Then I just click the option for creating a new page and add some content.

If I want to delete the page,

  * Navigate to the page to be removed.
  * Edit the page
  * Delete all of its content then click save
 
This will cause it to not show in the menu and be deleted.

## Creating a page on the folder

If I want to create a page that can be visited by clicking on the folder in the index menu.  
Then I just need to end the name of the page with `:start`  
So for example `tools:woodworking:start`

## Overriding the Sidebar

If you create a page called `sidebar` at any point 
within the directory structure.  
Then this will override the default sidebar on the left hand side with the menu.

Typically the default root sidebar is hidden in the menu, but you can navigate to it via `/doku.php?id=sidebar`  
The contents is the indexmenu plugin for showing page navigation.
